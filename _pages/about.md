Hi there! 

I am a PhD candidate in Medical Physics at Stony Brook University and a research collaborator at Weill Cornell Medicine. My work focuses on developing hardware and software to enhance the imaging performance of PET scanners.

Before starting my PhD, I spent a year in Shanghai as a radiotherapy algorithm engineer, where I focused on designing and optimizing cancer treatment using radiotherapy, as well as implementing and verifying algorithms for cancer treatment planning systems. Prior to that, I earned both my master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Nuclear Science, conducting research on acceleration of Monte Carlo particle transport and design of radiation detectors.

Outside of research, I enjoy staying active outdoors through road trips and hiking trails.
